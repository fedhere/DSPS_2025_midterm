# RULES: DSPS 2023 midterm

You are allowed to consult any resource except for live-interacting people (except the instructors)

You are welcome to ask questions: ask live or post on the slack #midterm channel https://dsps2023.slack.com/archives/C05V2TQ490X. Do so discretely by raising your hand or coming to the front of the room.

You are allowed to leave the room, but please leave your technology (phone and laptop etc) behind.

READ all of the instructions carefully! I promise this will help you!

You can use the hints that are linked to the instructions as you wish (also allowed to ignore them and come up with different ways to get the solution!) - you will not be penalized for using hints

You are allowed to use the shortcuts and partial solutions. If you are stuck on a step for more than a few minutes with no progress DO NOT STAY STUCK! You can go back and do the steps later and you will get points for those steps. Do not stay stuck!!

Turn in your work by 
1) changing the name of the colab notebook replacing "instructions" with your last name
2) sharing the link to your colab notebook with me (fbianco@udel.edu) and Willow Fox Fortino (fortino@udel.edu)

Your grade is compiled based on the notebook as it is rendered. Your notebook should run on Colab. If it does not you will get 10% fewer points. If it does not because you went back to some tasks indicate so in the notebook.

Remember figure captions, axis labels, stating significant thresholds before the analysis is performed, comment on strengths and weaknesses of the analysis
