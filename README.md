# RULES: DSPS 2025 midterm

You are allowed to consult any resource except for live-interacting people (except the instructors)

You are welcome to ask questions: ask live or post on the slack #midterm channel https://dspsudel.slack.com/archives/C05V2TQ490X. If live do so discreetly by raising your hand or coming to the front of the room so as to not to bother other students.

You are allowed to leave the room, but please leave your technology (phone and laptop etc) behind.

READ all of the instructions carefully! I promise this will help you!

You can use the hints that are linked to the instructions as you wish (also allowed to ignore them and come up with different ways to get the solution!) - you will not be penalized for using hints. 

You are allowed to use the shortcuts and partial solutions. If you are stuck on a step for more than several minutes with no progress DO NOT STAY STUCK! You can go back and do the steps later and you will get points for those steps. Do not stay stuck!!

Turn in your work by 
1) changing the name of the colab notebook replacing "instructions" with your last name
2) sharing the link to your colab notebook with me (fbianco@udel.edu)

Your grade is compiled based on the notebook as it is rendered. Your notebook should run on Colab. If it does not you will get 20% fewer points. If it does not because you went back to some tasks indicate so in the notebook. But if you leave in the links to the data or codes used when taking shortcuts the code should work.

Remember figure captions, axis labels, stating significant thresholds before the analysis is performed, and comment on strengths and weaknesses of the analysis
